# Task Compliance Registry

This registry serves as a centralized document for quality control over the technical task implementations for the **Universal Documentation Engine (UDE) MVP v1.0**.

The registry contains aggregated results of the audits conducted on each developed task to verify compliance with five core quality criteria (Atomicity, TDD, Traceability, Security, and Path Portability). The complete specification for the verification procedure is defined in the local `task-verification` standard.
